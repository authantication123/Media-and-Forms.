    <h1>ENTITIES</h1>
    <p>An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Citations of statute law, eg, “29 USC § 794 (d),” are the matter most likely to reference this character.</li>
            <li>The en dash is used between two quantities or dates to suggest a range, and is indistinguishable from a proper minus sign (&minus;/&#8722;). However, it should always be distinguished from a hyphen (&#45;), which is used to separate the parts of an ad hoc compound word.</li>
            <li>The pilcrow, used to mark the beginning of paragraphs that might otherwise be ambiguous, is useful when setting teaser copy. The print distribution of Rolling Stone magazine has often used such an approach. In technical writing, it might also be useful for marking an orphaned first line of a paragraph. ¶ Paragraphs marked with this symbol will most often be assigned a display value of inline, which will be explained in the introduction to the CSS layout model</li>
            <li>Low quotes are used in several Central and Eastern European langauges in preference to the analogous English opening quote characters.</li>
            <li>These are the members of the automated “Smart Quotes” set of characters incorporated into most popular word processing platforms. They are often encoded at vendor-specific code positions rather than Unicode or ISO Latin code positions, which can cause problems when they are copied into a Web document.</li>
